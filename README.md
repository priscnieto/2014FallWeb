Projects in Web Programming during Fall2014

When looking for certain features that an fitness app should have, I tried to go through my own experiences of trying out 
fitness apps and what I would do differently with them.
Here I have provided a list of features that would be useful for the app.

1. Weight Tracker (User inputs personal information like weight, height, maybe a weekly reminder)
2. Food Tracker (User inputs what food he/she has eaten, can be helpful in looking at how much or how little someone
   ate, having a barcode scanner can help calculate calories.
3. A Proposed Workout plan for each person and it helps with how much they want to lose or target spots.
4. Inspiration (maybe images or videos of fitness, I know that inspires me to work harder)
    to add to this, maybe food images or recipes
5. Daily Motivational quotes or sayings
6. Daily run calculation. When to rest, when to jog, run and timing as well as tracking distance


Ver1:
  As the app opens there will be a option to login or sign up. 
  As the user signs up he/she can input his/her weight, age, height, and other features
  Then there will be a menu, weight tracker, and a program that is designed for him/her to follow. As he/she runs, 
  he/she can input a playlist to play while running/jogging. Daily run calculation as well.
  Also will be daily motivational quotes
  
Ver2:
  As the app opens there will be a option to login or sign up. 
  As the user signs up he/she can input his/her weight, age, height, and other features
  Here she can track how much he/she eats and scan the barcode of whatever is eaten. If homemade, calories should be
  added to daily food tracker. 
  There will be an estimate of calorie intake and what the recommended calorie intake should be for weight loss
  Also will be daily motivational quote
